# ScoutTool
Uses the robotevents ApiV2 which requires a key.  The key is imported from the config file.

## robotevents.py
Robotevents.py will pull all the events with key holder teams involved.  This can be edited.  It will list the events, the teams in each event as well as each teams stats.
All the data is exported into excel spreadsheet to be used as a scouting tool.

## skillsrank.py
Skillsrank.py will ask for "Event Region" and "Grade Level" and create a table of
the regions skillsrank page.  If you leave either filed blank, you will get all
regions or grade levels.
